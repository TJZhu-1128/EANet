These audios are the evaluation reasults of the article:'Endpoint-Aware Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Utilizing Dynamic Weight Modulation Based on SNR Estimation'
The "simulation" folder contains artificially added noise data.
The "real-world" folder consists of six speech data samples from four speakers under three driving conditions extracted from the AVICAR dataset. 
Both folders include noisy audio as well as enhanced audio files.
